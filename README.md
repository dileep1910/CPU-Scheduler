# CPU-Scheduler
A web-based simulation tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize how different CPU scheduling algorithms work in real time. The platform allows users to add processes, simulate execution, and instantly view Gantt charts and performance metrics such as waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.

This simulator helps students, developers, and OS learners understand the internal behavior of scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SJF, Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin, enabling clear comparison and deeper conceptual understanding through an interactive and user-friendly interface.
